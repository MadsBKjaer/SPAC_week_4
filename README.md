# Week 4: Integrating MySQL with Python
## Before running
Create a .env file with a line like: 
* env_key = "user=your_username,password=your_password,host=your_host,port=your_port"

Example of entry in .env file that allows for connecting to localhost:
* localhost = "user=root,password=*****,host=localhost,port=3306"
* Swap "*****" for you actual password.

## Workflow
1. First iteration was focus on basic functionality.
2. Second iteration is more focus on streamlining the code and writing doc strings with doc tests.
